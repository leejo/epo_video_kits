# EPO Recording Kits

---
class: center, middle
### We bought brand new recording equipment for LPW 2017:

Cameras

Memory Cards

Wireless Microphones

Tripods

Adapters

Cables

x3

---
class: center, middle
### Amanda, Sawyer, and I operated the equipment

Amanda kindly provided screen capture devices (x3)

Amanda also edited the videos after the workshop

???

The editing took a few weeks due to the time of year

Plus editing is a time sink, even for simple content like this

Hand wavy estimate: every hour of recording takes about two hours of editing

So for LPW 2017: about 48 hours of editing time

---
class: center, middle
### It worked pretty well:

![](img/LPW_2017.png)

We did have some minor glitches with the sound capture

???

The problems with the sound we think were because the wireless mics were of low quality

And/or use of rechargeable batteries played a part

---
class: center, middle
### Prior to that it worked ... ok-ish

class: center, middle
### APW 2016

![](img/APW_2016.png)

???

This was using a kit from work, we just put the camera at the back of the room and let it roll

Nicholas kindly helped me out with this

I blogged about the setup

---
class: center, middle
### SPW 2017

![](img/SPW_2017.png)

???

These are both using a single camera + shotgun mic setup

That "works" but is heavily dependent on the room size and lighting

---
class: center, middle
### Recording priorities

--

1) Be able to hear the speaker

--

2) Be able to see/read the slides

--

3) Promote sponsors

--

4) Be able to see the speaker

--

5) Overlays for information

--

6) Live streaming

--

7) Editing to add intro / outro

--

8) High resolution (1080p+)

???

The last one is debatable as I don't think it's necessary to have high resolution for these types of recording given the content and it's easier to deal with smaller file sizes

---
class: center, middle
### Post LPW 2017 we wanted the kits to become a community resource

???

We spent in the region of â‚¬2,500 on equipment

Larger and longer workshops are probably paying at least 5 figures if they're having the recordings done professionally and/or buying equipment

That's a significant chunk of the budget, which could be saved with a shared resource

We're pretty technical people, so we can do this ourselves

It just needs a bit of prep and organisation

And it doesn't need to be prefect (see previous list of priorities)

---
class: center, middle
### Mark, Tom, and Finn did a lot to improve the kits for TPCiG:

Added a desktop computer for storage + streaming

Setup up OBS for capture and streaming

Bought better microphones

Better tripods

Created an Input/Output splitter board

More adapters

Cables

Gaffer Tape

x3

class: center, middle
### This worked really well

![](img/TPC_2018.png)

???

All 3 rooms were live streamed and a Raspberry Pi used as a control console so that they could pause between talks and have something displayed.

ACT (via an API) was used to grab talk titles and details to do the now and next live for each room.

---
class: center, middle
### The kits now look like this:

![](img/EPO_kit.jpg)

1 of 3 (Camelia for scale)

???

There are three of these, they weigh about 20kg each

The kits will all be used in Riga where the EPO hope to live stream once again (the EPO we will be using their own laptops for that so they can get the kits onto a plane).

The PC takes up half of that box, and a more compact tripod can be used

---
class: center, middle
### We used one kit for SPW 2018

![](img/SPW_livestream.png)

gibb (Gewerblich Industrielle Berufsschule Bern) had so much bandwidth ðŸ¤¤

???

That's the kit combining the three inputs (2x video + sound) and storing to the hd

Sending the feed live to youtube

And me *watching* the live stream at 1080p on youtube to check it was working

---
class: center, middle
### On YouTube

![](img/SPW_2018.png)

---
class: center, middle
### Index in the description (after live stream ends)

Means we don't have to spend hours (days even) editing the videos

![](img/SPW_2018_index.png)

???

I made sure to stop/start the capture (*not* the livestream) to the hd between talks to allow us to upload individual videos

I haven't done that yet though as there's been no request to do so

---
class: center, middle
### We had problems with the sound capture ðŸ˜ž

The wireless microphones have builtin auto gain control

The room's PA system confused these completely 

Or auto gain is just a bad idea for this kind of content?

???

So the kits aren't perfect depending on the venue

We need better wireless microphones

---
class: center, middle
### As I said, these are now a community resource

--

They require prep and organisation to get them where they need to be used

--

They're relatively trivial to setup and operate

--

A small donation to maintain / improve the kits is very welcome


???

In fact donations are essential: For Riga the donations are also helping to fund Tom, Finn and Marc to attend and manage the streaming, Shadowcat is paying some of this as well.

All donations are recorded and added to the list of equipment sponsors that goes onto the next streamed event using the OBS overlays.

--

(Better wireless mics are needed, that *don't* have auto gain control builtin)

--

(Replacing the desktop PCs with laptops would be good)

--

If you want to use them for a workshop then contact myself or Mark Keating

### We will try to use one kit again for the Swiss Perl Workshop this year

August 16th and 17th, Olten, Switzerland:

<a href="http://perl-workshop.ch">http://perl-workshop.ch</a>

![](img/SPW_2019.png)

???

Although it's unlikely we will livestream this year due to lack of bandwidth
